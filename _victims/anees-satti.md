## **Verified Timeline of Events**

- **November 26, 2024:**
  - **Mid-Afternoon** Anees Shahzad was photographed at the protest near D-Chowk, Islamabad, holding a framed portrait of Imran Khan while dressed in a black hoodie, pants, a PTI-colored headscarf or hat, and a face mask. He carried a backpack, suggesting he came prepared for an extended stay at the protest, and appeared unarmed, participating peacefully in the demonstration. A metro bus station can be seen in the background, which we believe to be the [Shaheed-e-Millat Station South](https://maps.app.goo.gl/shpovsqXno2mh9a66) based on analysis of Street View data on Google Maps.

      <em>Anees Shahzad Satti, unarmed and holding a portrait of Imran Khan during the PTI protest at D-Chowk on November 26, 2024. Witnesses, including his father, another relative, and a PTI official, stated that Anees was sitting on a pavement near Blue Area when he was fatally shot in the abdomen by a sniper from a nearby building. This is consistent with the injuries noted in his death certificate.  The shadows suggest the photo was taken mid-afternoon, likely between 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM, aligning with his hospital admission at 3:41 PM.</em>

    A video that appeared online later showed an individual matching Anees’s clothing and accessories being carried away after being shot, further corroborating his presence and circumstances at the protest. His hat and backpack can be seen as he is transferred on to a motorcycle. The markings on the road, sidewalks and the background match the areas near the identified metro station.
